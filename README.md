here i made a form having fields Name,email,contact,dob.

on submitting form the data will submmitted in database(Taskdb) table(Form) and data will save there after successfull submission the page will show all the Submiited Data.

view(View.php) is named for viewing database data where we can edit(edit.php) and delete(delete.php) data.
